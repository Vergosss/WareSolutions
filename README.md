Fourth-Year Obligatory Course: Software Engineering 2022-2023 Project
Warehouse and Stock Management System (WareSolutions).

Project Description: 
The company will use this specific application for optimal management, storage, and transportation of its goods and products in the warehouses at its disposal. 
Through the application, the company will be able to make decisions that minimize the delivery time of products to customers, while also being able to monitor at any given moment the location of each product in each warehouse and its specific section. 
If it becomes necessary, for efficiency reasons, to change the storage location of a product, the corresponding management departments of the respective warehouses will be notified through the application. 
Additionally, this application will be connected to a platform through which customers, once registered in the system, will be able to place their orders. 
Finally, access to the system will be granted to the corresponding warehouse and stock management department of the company, the department responsible for managing each warehouse, as well as to customers who will be able to view the availability and invoice of products and goods, allowing them to place orders if desired.
